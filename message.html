        <p>TO THE MOST BELOVED LOVE OF MY LIFE,<br><br>
            My dear mimi 🫶🏻, ever since we met on the 8th of November my life has been so much happier so much more
            peaceful and sooooo fun🌷🌷! You bring out a side of me i did not know existed. You make everything fun and
            i
            wait when i get to talk to you👉👈.. Ik i can be dumb sometimes making you angry or hurting you but please
            know
            this baby i love you the mosttt❤️. I care for you and i want to make you happy❤️,so please forgive the silly
            mistakes i make🙏. I want you for the rest of my life🌷. I want to spend my time with you, give you warm
            hugs,
            kisses, hold your hands, do silly things with you, fall asleep with you and do everything we possibly
            can🫶🏻.
            Unfortunately, we are far but i will always try to make sure you dont feel less loved everrr. You are
            someone i want for the rest of my life. Every message i wrote this week was from my heart and i mean it! I
            will try to make sure i keep all the words i said but if i do mess up please remind me. I want to know every
            bit there is to know about you and want to belong onlyyyy to my babyy. Even if we are far trust me i only
            wish for you to be with me. You have no idea how much i crave for you👉👈. I find it difficult to say on
            calls(even i dont like calls) but trust me i do love you more than i say. If you ever feel any kind of
            problem please let me know. I want us to talk through everything and be together always! I keep waiting for
            the days we will be together and i can keep you all to myself(in a good way).I mean i do get a littleeeeee
            jealous of your classmates but then i will deal with it. The way you make me feel is something no has ever
            and no one will ever make me feel. It can only be you my loveee. I am a little clingy with you and a lottttt
            obssesed with you but you are so pretty i cant help it baba❤️! I want to give you every last bit of love i
            have for my babyy
            because it's all for you. I am still not able to express everything and i hope you can give me time to do
            so! I will learn to love you better and make you happier than now but until then i hope you can forgive my
            mistakes and love me. In the past few months you have become really important to me and i fall in love with
            you every single day. I love you my Valentine, I love you no matter what i say or dont say, always remember
            that mimi!</p>
        With Love,<br>
        Your Baby
